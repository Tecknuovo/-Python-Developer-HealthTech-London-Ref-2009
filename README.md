# Stack: 

Python Developer / Python / Numpy / TensorFlow / AWS / Docker / HealthTech  

# Would you like to work on a project that combines our increased understanding of human biology with the latest technologies and scientific theory? 

If you are a strong Python developer who is busy wading through a slew of FinTech positions thinking there must be ways that technology can better serve humanity, then this might be the role for you. Working with a team of globally renowned scientists focussed on the study of microbiomes and how they effect everything from how we breakdown food to how quickly our bodies absorb nutrients and keep our immune systems functioning. There is more diversity in human biomes than exists on our DNA and these team of people are looking to create highly specialised diets based on our responses to specific food groups and ability to process them. 

# What would you be doing? 

You would be technical hire number three joining a hands-on CTO and one other Python developer. The immediate challenge is build out a data pipeline and the tools to be used by the data science team to best analyse the results of scientific trails that involve real time inputs by users and the data from highly sensitive glucose sensors. 

# What experience is required?

-	Demonstrable previous experience of building out Backend Python applications 
-	An interest in Data Science and Machine learning 
-	Exposure to working in a DevOps culture and the associated tools
-	An interest in working for an early stage start up
